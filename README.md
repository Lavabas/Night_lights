## üåç Data Source

- **Dataset**: VIIRS DNB Monthly Composites from NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP Satellite  
- **Original Access**: [NASA Earthdata VIIRS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/)

**Note**: The official `.zip` archive provided for the VIIRS GeoTIFFs failed to unzip on Windows (likely due to compression format or file corruption).  
Therefore, the `.tif` files were **downloaded and exported manually from Google Earth Engine (GEE)** to ensure correct formatting and projection.
